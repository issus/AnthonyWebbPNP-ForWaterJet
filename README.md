# Anthony Webb's Pick and Place modified for Waterjet
Anthony's Pick and Place machine is simple, low cost, and mechanically sturdy based on 12mm linear rail, rather than V bearings running on aluminium extrusion.

The purpose of this version of his machine design is to be cut on a waterjet (or a laser) from 1/4" material (Aluminium) with little to no finishing required. Some changes to the design have been significant to work around areas that had counterbores, or were tapped. Anthony's original design is quite versatile as it supports 12mm and 15mm rails, this design is intended only for the cheaper 12mm rail which Anthony is using on his own machine. The idler pulleys however do have slots to allow from 20T to 32T (12mm -> 16mm diameter) pulleys and still maintain alignment.

# Modifications
This version of his machine has been redrafted from scratch in Solidworks, with input from Anthony on the changes I am making to ensure they fit the spirit of his original design. I have never used Autodesk's software, so it is quicker for me to redraw it. Once the design is complete, I'll publish generic STEP models for all the parts.

Due to the 8020 Inc distributor in Canada stocking very little in the way of metric extrustion, and charging signficantly more for metric than imperial - this machine has been converted to use imperial extrusion. 

All the mounting plates have changed to remove the need for counterbores which the waterjet cannot cut. I've added a couple of extra features in places, and will continue to do so, to support easy drag chain mounting, limit switches and the likes.

Everything has been converted to 1/4" plate, the original design was machined from plastic and therefore had thicker sections.

This design will use Peter Betz's head which will also be waterjet cut. He is in the process of modifying his head design to be easier to waterjet manufacture, and add features for this machine.


# Todo
* Add limit switches
* Add drag chain supports
* Add Peter's head design
* Source 5mm T slot nuts
* Put together bill of materials
